                I moved from Chicago to Austin three years ago because of work. 
                I enjoy the hot weather in Texas. Without snow, 
                nice weather makes my life much easier. If you ask me how about Texas, 
                I would like to use three things to describe Texas: BBQ, wild flowers 
                and large parking spot.

            <p> As a software engineer, performing system test, solving technical problems 
                and reading/analyzing error messages are my daily jobs. Sometimes, work is hard 
                when you expose to an unknown environment or explore new technologies, 
                but I believe doing critical thinking and learning from experienced people 
                would help us to conquer all challenges.
